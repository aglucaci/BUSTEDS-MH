   "info":"BUSTED-SMSH (branch-site unrestricted statistical test of episodic diversification) uses a random effects branch-site model fitted\njointly to all or a subset of tree branches in order to test for alignment-wide evidence of episodic diversifying selection and.\nAssuming there is evidence of positive selection (i.e. there is an omega > 1),  BUSTED will also perform a quick evidence-ratio\nstyle analysis to explore which individual sites may have been subject to selection. v2.0 adds support for synonymous rate variation,\nand relaxes the test statistic to 0.5 (chi^2_0 + chi^2_2). Version 2.1 adds a grid search for the initial starting point.\nVersion 2.2 changes the grid search to LHC, and adds an initial search phase to use adaptive Nedler-Mead.\n",
